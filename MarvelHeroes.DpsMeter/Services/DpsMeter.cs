    //     bosses; for that mode we want a Recount/Skada-style "this fight" breakdown.
    //   • Self-owner election (section 3 in OnDamageDealt) still uses the 60s window in
    //     the heuristic-fallback path — ripping that out would destabilise mid-session
    //     attaches.  Cheaper to feed both windows than to refactor the election logic.
